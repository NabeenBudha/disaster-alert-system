# Disaster Alert System

This is a simple **Disaster Alert System** developed in **C** that uses a **text file** (`disaster_database.txt`) to store disaster information. The system allows users to add, view, and get alerts for disasters based on their scale.

## Features

- **Add Disaster**: Allows users to input disaster details like name, location, date, time, type, number of deaths, and scale.
- **View Disasters**: Displays a list of all recorded disasters stored in the text file.
- **Show Alerts**: Alerts are shown for disasters with a scale greater than 5, indicating significant disasters.
